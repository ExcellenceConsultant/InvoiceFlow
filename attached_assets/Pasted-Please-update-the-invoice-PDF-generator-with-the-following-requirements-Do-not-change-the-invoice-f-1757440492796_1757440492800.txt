Please update the invoice PDF generator with the following requirements. Do not change the invoice format, fonts, or alignment. Follow these rules strictly:

1. Page Setup

Paper size: A4 (210mm x 297mm).

Margins: Top 50mm, Bottom 40mm, Left 20mm, Right 20mm.

Safe content area: X=20mm, Y=50mm, Width=170mm, Height=207mm.

Do not generate letterhead (logo or company address) — invoice will be printed on pre-printed company letterhead.

2. Invoice Details Section (Show on All Pages)

On every page, after the header space, print the invoice details section in the same format:
